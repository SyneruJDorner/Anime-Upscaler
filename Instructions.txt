How To Use:
	-Place your desired video into "Input Video"
	-Run either:
		-Upscale_Anime_CPU.bat*
		-Upscale_Anime_GPU.bat*
		-Upscale_Anime_CUDNN.bat*
	-Follow the instructions on command prompt.

	*READ THE IMPORTATNT MESSAGE BELOW!

Whats still needs to be done:
	-Auto detection of CUDA, GPU and CPU in one batch file.
	-Auto detection the video frame rate, that way you wont need to input it when prompted.
	-Recompile video with all audio, subtitles and markers when upscaled video is rendered.

IMPORTANT:
There are 3 variation of the project:
	-CPU based Upscale (Slow)
	-GPU based Upscale (Medium)
	-CUDNN based Upscale (FAST)

	In most cases from what I am aware of CPU and GPU should work on most system.
	In the case of CUDNN you need a nvidia card with CUDA 3.0 or higher.
	If you do not have CUDA installed and you have a nvidia card download at:
	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

	You will also need a ton of free space as the upscaled images are huge.
	The 00:40:00 anime took around 300 gigs. 00:01:40 took about 5 gigs.
	These are also dependant on the number of frames of the anime (more fames means more space).
	
TESTS (hh:mm:ss):
	-750  ti (640 CUDA cores), took about 16-18 hours to upscale a 50:00:00 minute anime from 640×480 to 1280×960.
	-1660 ti (1536 CUDA cores), took about 1 hour to upscale a 00:01:40 minute anime from 480x270 to 960x540.
